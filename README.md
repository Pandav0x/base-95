# Base95

This was a project I did while being 1st year student to make brute-force attacks in C less a hassle. I didn't know about libraries with similar aim at the time.

This project contains a structure with operators for a base 95 counting system.

Also, this project is in the C89 standard because that's the version I learned first while in high school (i.e. why the iterators are defined outside the `for` statement for instance).

Overall, the project was fun and worked well for what I needed.
